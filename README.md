# twoDparticleTracking version 2.0


-THE ONLY FILE WHICH NEEDS TO BE RUN IS twoDparticleTracking.m, other files only need to be on the MATLAB path.
-The bfmatlab folder contains a matlab package which is needed for opening the microscopy files. 
-2DparticleTrack folder contains 2 dimensional particle tracking algorithm for microscopy image series i.e. 2D particle tracking in time dimension. The folder is a combination of algorithms (developed by professionals) I found suitable for the purpose and algorithms made by me.
-startup.m file needs to be moved to the MATLAB root folder, since its sole purpose is to direct the files in the 2DparticleTrack directory into the MATLAB path so the user doesn't need to worry about that. Startup.m is then run every time
the user starts MATLAB and thus the files are always on the path i.e. MATLAB can run them when they are needed.

Version 2.0 can only read .oir files
