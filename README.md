# twoDparticleTracking version 2.0

-THE ONLY FILE WHICH NEEDS TO BE RUN IS twoDparticleTracking.m, other files only need to be on the MATLAB path.
-The bfmatlab folder contains a matlab package which is needed for opening the microscopy files. 
-2DparticleTrack folder contains 2 dimensional particle tracking algorithm for microscopy image series i.e. 2D particle tracking in time dimension. The folder is a combination of algorithms (developed by professionals) I found suitable for the purpose and algorithms made by me.

Version 2.0 can only read .oir files
